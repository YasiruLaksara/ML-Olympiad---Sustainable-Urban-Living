# ML Olympiad - Sustainable Urban Living üè°

## Overview

Finding a suitable place to live is a crucial decision that significantly impacts your well-being. While online listings provide information, it can be challenging to assess a property's true "habitability" based solely on descriptions. This is where AI can lend a helping hand!

This project was part of the Kaggle competition, **ML Olympiad - Sustainable Urban Living**, where I developed a machine learning model to predict the habitability score of a property based on available details. The goal was to create a user-friendly system that empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their living spaces.

**Competition Result:** ü•â 3rd Place  
**Goal:** Develop an ML model that predicts the Sustainable Habitability Score of a property based on the provided data.

## Key Approaches

In the pursuit of the best model for predicting habitability scores, several approaches were explored. Below are the main strategies and techniques used:

1. **Utilization of Cross-Validation Strategy:**

   - Employed rigorous cross-validation to evaluate various algorithms, including RandomForest Regressor, XGB Regressor, LGBM Regressor, MLP Regressor (Neural Network), DecisionTree Regressor, Lasso, GradientBoosting Regressor, and Linear Regression.

2. **Training with RandomForest Regressor:**

   - Focused on optimizing the performance of the RandomForest Regressor by fine-tuning hyperparameters.

3. **Training with XGB Regressor:**

   - Similar optimization efforts were made with XGB Regressor to enhance model accuracy.

4. **Ensemble Methods (Stacked Regressor):**
   - **Method 1:** Combined RandomForest Regressor and XGB Regressor.
   - **Method 2:** Expanded the ensemble to include LGBM Regressor and MLP Regressor (Neural Network), in addition to RandomForest and XGB Regressors.

## Results Comparison

The models were evaluated based on Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R¬≤ Score across various datasets (training, validation, and test sets). The ensemble method in **Approach 4 - Method 2** emerged as the top performer:

| Approach              | RMSE     | MAE      | MSE       | R¬≤ Score  | Competition Score |
| --------------------- | -------- | -------- | --------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| Approach 2            | 5.68     | 4.40     | 32.28     | 0.839     | 5.96980           |
| Approach 3            | 5.72     | 4.44     | 32.68     | 0.837     | 5.98977           |
| Approach 4 (Method 1) | 5.68     | 4.40     | 32.21     | 0.839     | 5.94858           |
| Approach 4 (Method 2) | **5.55** | **4.33** | **30.85** | **0.846** | **5.67223**       |

## Discussion

Overall, the ensemble methods, particularly **Approach 4 - Method 2**, provided the highest predictive accuracy, consistently outperforming other approaches. This suggests that ensemble learning can significantly enhance model performance in predicting habitability scores.
